.Sh DESCRIPTION
Creates a parser for a single dive extracted from the dive computer with
.Xr dc_device_foreach 3 .
The parser operates on the data extracted: it does not touch the device
directly to acquire data.
Thus, there are two forms of invocation:
.Nm dc_parser_new ,
which extracts relevant values from the
.Fa device
parameter; and
.Nm dc_parser_new2 ,
which is given device values (model, etc.) directly.
.Pp
The pointer must later be freed with
.Xr dc_parser_destroy 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These return
.Dv DC_STATUS_OK ,
and fill in the
.Fa parser
pointer on success.
Otherwise, an error is returned.
